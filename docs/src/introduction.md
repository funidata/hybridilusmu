# Introduction

Hybridilusmu is a Slack application designed to facilitate modern hybrid work. The main functionality revolves around easily sharing information about when and where from you are working.

The project was initially developed as a course project by a group of students from University of Helsinki, and later taken over by [Funidata](https://www.funidata.fi/).
